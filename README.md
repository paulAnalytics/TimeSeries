1.1.	Project Summary

The project involves predicting monthly camping gear sales for a store using both traditional forecasting methods and machine learning. Sponsored by the Makridakis Open Forecasting Center (MOFC) at the University of Nicosia, the competition aims to enhance forecasting accuracy. The dataset, sourced from Walmart, comprises hierarchical sales data from stores in California, Texas, and Wisconsin, including item details, departments, product categories, and store information. Explanatory variables like price, promotions, day of the week, and special events are also included.

1.2.	Business Value

Accurate forecasting is crucial for businesses to avoid losses and capitalize on opportunities. The MOFC, with its expertise and Makridakis Competitions, plays a key role in advancing forecasting theory and practice. Success in this project can lead to improved forecasting methods applicable across various business areas, aiding in inventory management and service level optimization.

1.3.	Scope of the Project:

The project involves utilizing a comprehensive dataset to forecast daily for 28 days. It challenges participants to employ both traditional and machine learning-based forecasting methods. The scope extends beyond individual store sales, encompassing item level, departmental, and product category forecasts. The inclusion of explanatory variables enhances the robustness of the dataset.

1.4.	Desired Result

The desired outcome is an advancement in forecasting accuracy, contributing to the theory and practice of forecasting. Successful models can be applied in diverse business contexts, helping organizations set appropriate inventory levels, refine service strategies, and make informed decisions. The MOFC aims to disseminate the developed tools and knowledge to support businesses in achieving more precise and well-calibrated forecasts, reducing waste, and effectively managing uncertainty and associated risks.
